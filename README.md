# Complete Guide: Publishing Your Underpants Library to npm

This guide will help you transform your completed Underpants project into a publishable npm package that others can install and use.

## 1. Update Your package.json

Replace your current `package.json` with this updated version:

```json
{
  "name": "@your-github-username/underpants",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Functional utility library - student implementation of underscore.js",
  "main": "underpants.js",
  "keywords": ["functional", "utilities", "underscore", "lodash", "functional-programming"],
  "author": "Your Name <your.email@example.com>",
  "license": "MIT",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/your-github-username/underpants.git"
  },
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/your-github-username/underpants/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/your-github-username/underpants#readme",
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=12.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "mocha test/*.spec.js",
    "test:browser": "open index.html"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "chai": "^4.3.7",
    "mocha": "^10.2.0"
  },
  "files": [
    "underpants.js",
    "README.md",
    "LICENSE"
  ]
}
```

### Key Changes Made:
- **Removed `"private": true`** - This was preventing npm publishing
- **Changed name** to use your GitHub username as a scope (`@your-github-username/underpants`)
- **Updated license** from "CC" to "MIT" (more standard for npm packages)
- **Added `files` array** - Specifies exactly what gets published to npm
- **Updated repository URLs** - Point to your GitHub repo
- **Added keywords** - Help people find your package

**Important:** Replace `your-github-username`, `Your Name`, and `your.email@example.com` with your actual information!

## 2. Create Additional Required Files

### LICENSE File
Create a file named `LICENSE` (no extension) in your project root:

```

```

### Updated README.md
Replace your current README.md with this npm-focused version:

```markdown
# @your-github-username/underpants

A functional utility library implementing underscore.js-style functions. Created as part of a coding bootcamp exercise.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @your-github-username/underpants
```

## Usage

### Node.js
```javascript
const _ = require('@your-github-username/underpants');

console.log(_.identity(42)); // 42
console.log(_.first([1, 2, 3], 2)); // [1, 2]
console.log(_.map([1, 2, 3], x => x * 2)); // [2, 4, 6]
```

### Browser
```html
<script src="node_modules/@your-github-username/underpants/underpants.js"></script>
<script>
    console.log(_.identity(42)); // 42
</script>
```

## Available Functions

- `_.identity(value)` - Returns the value unchanged
- `_.typeOf(value)` - Returns the type of value as a string
- `_.first(array, n)` - Returns the first n elements of an array
- `_.last(array, n)` - Returns the last n elements of an array
- `_.indexOf(array, value)` - Returns the index of the first occurrence of value
- `_.contains(array, value)` - Returns true if array contains value
- `_.each(collection, function)` - Iterates over collection calling function for each element
- `_.unique(array)` - Returns array with duplicates removed
- `_.filter(array, predicate)` - Returns elements that pass the predicate test
- `_.reject(array, predicate)` - Returns elements that fail the predicate test
- `_.partition(array, predicate)` - Splits array into two arrays based on predicate
- `_.map(collection, function)` - Creates new array with results of calling function on each element
- `_.pluck(array, property)` - Extracts property values from array of objects
- `_.every(collection, predicate)` - Returns true if all elements pass predicate test
- `_.some(collection, predicate)` - Returns true if any element passes predicate test
- `_.reduce(array, function, seed)` - Reduces array to single value using function
- `_.extend(object, ...sources)` - Copies properties from sources to object

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

Open browser tests:
```bash
npm run test:browser
```

## Development

This library was created as part of a coding bootcamp exercise to understand functional programming concepts and utility libraries like underscore.js and lodash.
```

**Remember:** Replace `@your-github-username` with your actual GitHub username throughout the README!

## 3. Publishing Steps

Follow these steps in order to publish your package to npm:

### Step 1: Ensure All Functions Are Implemented
Make sure you've completed all the function implementations in `underpants.js`. All tests should be passing:
```bash
npm test
```

### Step 2: Create npm Account
1. Go to [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com)
2. Click "Sign Up" and create an account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 3: Test Your Package Locally
Before publishing, test that your package works:
```bash
# Test that your module can be required
node -e "console.log(require('./underpants.js').identity(42))"

# Test a few more functions
node -e "const _ = require('./underpants.js'); console.log(_.map([1,2,3], x => x*2))"
```

### Step 4: Login to npm
In your terminal, login to npm:
```bash
npm login
```
Enter your npm username, password, and email when prompted.

### Step 5: Publish Your Package
```bash
npm publish --access public
```

The `--access public` flag is required for scoped packages (packages with `@username/` in the name).

## 4. Using Your Published Package

Once published, anyone can install and use your library:

### Installation
```bash
npm install @your-github-username/underpants
```

### Usage Example
```javascript
const _ = require('@your-github-username/underpants');

// Test various functions
console.log(_.identity(42)); // 42
console.log(_.typeOf([1,2,3])); // "array"
console.log(_.first([1,2,3,4,5], 3)); // [1,2,3]
console.log(_.map([1,2,3], x => x * 2)); // [2,4,6]
console.log(_.filter([1,2,3,4,5], x => x % 2 === 0)); // [2,4]

// Use it with real data
const users = [
  {name: 'Alice', age: 25},
  {name: 'Bob', age: 30},
  {name: 'Carol', age: 28}
];

console.log(_.pluck(users, 'name')); // ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol']
console.log(_.every(users, user => user.age > 18)); // true
```

## 5. Updating Your Package

When you want to publish updates:

1. Make your changes
2. Update the version in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "version": "1.0.1"
   ```
3. Publish again:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

## Troubleshooting

**Package name already exists:** Use a different scoped name like `@yourname/underpants-v2`

**Permission denied:** Make sure you're logged in with `npm whoami`

**Tests failing:** Fix your function implementations before publishing

**Module not found:** Check that your `main` field in package.json points to the correct file

Congratulations! You've now published your own npm package that others can install and use! ðŸŽ‰
